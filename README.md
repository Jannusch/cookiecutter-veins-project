## Running ##

Save the contents of this repository to disk, e.g., in `~/src/cookiecutter-veins-project` (that is, this file resides in `~/src/cookiecutter-veins-project/README.md`).

Open a terminal and switch to a directory that should contain your new project, e.g., `~/src`.

Run cookiecutter, e.g., as `cookiecutter ~/src/cookiecutter-veins-project`.
You will be prompted for a number of configuration variables (each with a default value, which you can accept by pressing the `enter` key).
After finishing, cookiecutter will have created a directory named after your `project_name_as_file_name` directory.
